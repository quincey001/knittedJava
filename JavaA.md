# Java EE (Java Enterprise Edition)

Java EE (Java Enterprise Edition) is a collection of Java APIs and technologies for building enterprise-level applications. </br>
It is a platform-independent, Java-based framework for building, deploying, and managing large-scale, multi-tiered, scalable, reliable, and secure network applications. </br>

Java EE includes a variety of APIs for different tasks, </br>
such as<span style="color:red;">servlets</span> for building web applications, </br>
<font color="red">JavaServer Pages (JSPs)</font> for generating dynamic web content, </br>
<font color="red">Java Persistence API (JPA)</font> for persisting data in databases, </br>
and <font color="red">Java Message Service (JMS)</font> for sending messages between components.</br>
<font color="red">Struts2</font> is a framework for building web applications based on the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern. It provides a flexible and extensible architecture for building dynamic web pages and handling user interactions.</br>
<font color="red">JSF (JavaServer Faces)</font> is a component-based framework for building user interfaces for Java EE web applications. It provides a standard set of UI components that can be used to build pages, as well as a set of standard navigation rules for controlling the flow of the application. </br>

# SaaS (Software as a service)

# Java SE (Java Standard Edition)
It is a platform for developing and deploying java applications on desktops and servers. It includes the Java Virtual Machine, Java Library(java API), and other tools for developing, debugging and monitoring java applications.

# Java Virtual Machine
It is a virtual machine to run the java code in the computer system. The Java code is compiled by JVM to be a Bytecode which allows machine/computers to understand.

# JRE (Java Runtime Environment)
It is a subset of JSE, which includes JVM, and Java Library. It is typically used to run java application on a user's computer

# Apache Tomcat
It is an open source web server and servlet container developed by the Apache Software Fundation.
It is used to deploy and run java servlets and javaServer Pages(JSPs) on a web server.

# JSP(Java Server Pages)
It is technology that allows developers to create dynamic web pages using conbination of HTML,CSS, and java code.
JSP are compiled into java servlets, which are then executed by the web server.

# Servlets
Servlets are java classes that run on the server side and can handle client requests and generate dynamic content.
