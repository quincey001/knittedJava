# what is oop in programming?
### OOP is one of programming aproaches, which is used for designing a program with classes and objects. 
### It is also a way to model real world objects into program/software objects, which contain data and code.
### It can also be characterized as data controlling for accessing the code.
## OOP in java is to improve the code readability and reusability by defining java program efficiently.
## The main principles of Object-oriented programming in java are encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism.

# what is an object?
object is a specific instance of a class where the object can be combined of data structures, functions, and variables.

# what is a class?
a class is a representation of a type of object or colletion of a object.

# what is super() and this()?
super in java is used to refer to methods, variables, constructors of a parent class.
This in java is used to refer to methods, variables and constructors of a current class.

# what are getter and setter method, and why should we use them?
A getter method in a class that retrieves and update the value of a private field and return it.
A setter method in a class that sets the values of a private field.
The purpose of these methods is to control, protect and access to private fields in a class.

# what is Encapsulation?
Encapsulation in object oriented programming usually has two meanings, one is the building of behaviour and attributes on a single object.
Another is the practice of hiding fields and some methods from public access.

# what is inheritance?
inheritance is a way to organize classes into a parent-child hierarchy, which allows the child inherit or reuse fields and methods from its parent.

# what is polymorphysm?
polymorphysm means many forms, such as animal has forms of fish and dogs, it makes the code simpler, we can use the base class or super class, it encourages the code extensibility.
