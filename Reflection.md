# what is reflection in java?
Reflection mechanism is build into the JVM and supported by java.lang.reflect package.
When a java class is loaded into JVM, the JVM creates a Class object for the class that contains information about the class, such as its name, its superclass, and the interfaces it implements.
This information is stored in a Class object and is used by the JVM to enforce access restrictions and perform othe operations, such as method invocations and field access.
With reflection, a program can use the Class object to access and manipuldate the structure of a class using java.lang.reflect package.
